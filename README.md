# Job Hunter AI

Supercharge your job search with Job Hunter AI, a Chrome extension that leverages generative AI to make applying for jobs faster and smarter.

## Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Resume Parsing
Instantly transform your PDF resume into structured data. Upload your resume, and the AI will intelligently extract your contact information, work experience, education, skills, and more, making it ready for autofilling applications.

### 2. Job Competitiveness Analysis
Don't just applyâ€”apply smart. Paste any job description into the extension to receive an instant AI-generated analysis. You'll get a match score as a percentage and a concise summary of your strengths and weaknesses for the role, helping you focus your efforts on the right opportunities.

### 3. Smart Answer Generation
Struggling with open-ended application questions like "Why do you want to work here?" or "What's your greatest strength?" Let the AI craft compelling, personalized answers for you. It uses the context of your resume (and the job description, if provided) to generate responses that highlight your qualifications.

### 4. Intelligent Autofill
Save time and reduce errors by automatically filling out job application forms. With a single click, Job Hunter AI populates fields with the data parsed from your resume, from basic contact info to detailed work experience.
