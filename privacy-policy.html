    <h1>Privacy Policy for Job Hunter AI</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 26, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Job Hunter AI ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our browser extension. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not use the extension.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Our extension processes information you provide directly to it. The data handled by the extension includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resume Data:</strong> When you upload your resume (in PDF format), the extension processes this document to extract relevant information such as your name, contact details, work experience, education, and skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Descriptions:</strong> When you paste a job description, the extension processes this text to analyze it against your resume data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>All your data is stored locally on your device's browser storage. We do not have a central server, and we do not collect or store your personal information on our servers.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We use the information you provide to enable the core functionalities of the extension:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To parse your resume and structure the data for easy access.</li>
        <li>To analyze a job description's competitiveness against your resume profile.</li>
        <li>To generate answers for common application questions based on your resume and the job description.</li>
        <li>To provide the "autofill" capability on job application forms (this feature is simulated in the web version and would interact with web pages in a live extension).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        To provide its AI-powered features, Job Hunter AI utilizes the Google Gemini API. When you use features like resume parsing, job analysis, or answer generation, the relevant text data (your resume text, the job description, and the question) is sent to the Google Gemini API for processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your use of these features is subject to Google's Privacy Policy. We recommend you review their policy to understand how they handle data: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your parsed resume data and other settings are stored exclusively in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local` in the extension or `localStorage` in the web simulation). This means your data remains on your computer. We do not transmit this stored data to any external server, except for the on-demand processing requests sent to the Google Gemini API as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
        While your data is stored locally, we encourage you to follow standard security practices for your computer and browser to protect your information.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, other than for the purpose of API calls to Google Gemini to provide the extension's functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
        You have complete control over your data. You can clear all data stored by the extension at any time by clearing your browser's storage for this extension or by uninstalling the extension.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
